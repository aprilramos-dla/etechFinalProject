      <div class="container">
            <p1> First, let’s define what desensitized means. As the merriam-webster dictionary defines it, desensitized is to make emotionally insensitive. In other words, it is being insensitive about different situations, or things involving emotions. The question here is, does being emotionally insensitive build up from the involvement of different influences in our life? </p1>

            <br> 

            <p2> Media is the main source of our information, may it be print media, broadcast media, or new media. Media is everywhere, it can be seen or heard. As it is our main source, there is almost always a surge of information coming right up to us, which can be a factor as to why we are slowly being desensitized. But how? </p2>
      
            <br>

            <p3>As I’ve mentioned ‘surge of information’, the feeling 
                of being overwhelmed can be part of the equation. With the presence of both negativity and positivity in media, is being desensitized can be equated to just being aware of the tactics behind everything?
                Now, I will answer my questions one by one. First, I think being emotionally insensitive is subjective. Everyone has different sensitivity levels, one thing may be sensitive for you but not for others, and vice versa. And yes, I do think that we are slowly being desensitized because of the big surge of media on our faces. </p3>

            <br>

            <p4> The feeling of being overwhelmed by seeing one 
                piece of information to another is something that 
                personally occurs to me often. As someone who is 
                easily bothered by something I see, read, or hear, I 
                think I’m slowly being disconnected from myself 
                and my emotions which leads to my answer to my 
                last question. 
                </p4>

            <br>

            <p5>
                Is being desensitized can be equated to just being 
aware of the tactics behind everything? When we really do think about it, I think the answer to this question is yes. Yes in a good way and a bad way. Although we do know the motives behind what is seen in the media, we are also desensitized to the point wherein there are times when we don’t think about what others will feel. A prime example will be an article about a celebrity, which I will keep anonymous, there are numerous people who commented but two of them stuck to me. The first one attacks the celebrity, and the second one attacks the one who commented first. Both of them are victims of desensitization due to the media.
